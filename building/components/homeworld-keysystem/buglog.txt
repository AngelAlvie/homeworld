This is a log of bugs that were found in this code, so that future maintainers can avoid causing the same bugs.

Bugs discovered by unit testing are not considered important bugs, since they were caught by unit testing.

Bugs that made it past unit testing, but were caught during integration testing:
 * keyclient would exit without running anything because the main loop was in a goroutine
    - this couldn't be unit-tested, because the main launch wasn't unit tested
    - no resolution possible, besides "be more careful"
 * keys were not checked for existence as blockers for certain actions
    - preconditions were not thoroughly considered for actions.
    - resolution TODO: check other preconditions
 * output files did not have their directories constructed for certain outputs
    - there should be an abstraction for writing a file and creating directories
    - resolution TODO: provide abstraction
 * the actloop was counted as unstable even when the only action left was erroring
    - this was introduced by badly-thought-through unit testing decisions
    - no resolution possible, besides "be more careful"
 * error messages started with uppercase letters and ended in punctuation
    - there was no consistent error message format defined
    - resolution TODO: define format, make it consistent
 * keygranting RSA private keys were not always being generated
    - this was a logic error
    - uncertain whether there's a good resolution to this
 * errors were sometimes being logged to the global logger instead of the defined logger
    - the logging target should be consistent
    - resolution TODO: make sure nothing is logged via 'log'
 * keygrant definitions were not allowed to contain zero dns names
    - this was a logic error, caused by overvalidating inputs
    - no easy resolution; should pay more attention to valid inputs; should try harder to not write unit tests closely to the code
 * fixed-expiration certificates were used in unit tests
    - unit tests should generally generate their certs
 * a new authority type (static authorities) were incorrectly treated as SSH authorities
    - logic should never assume that the authority type is one of a limited number of types
    - resolution TODO: make sure nothing else makes these assumptions

Bugs that made it past integration testing, but were caught during deployment into a development cluster:
 * None yet.

Bugs that affected a later development cluster:
 * None yet.

Bugs that got past a later development cluster and affected production:
