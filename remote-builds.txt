Here's how to do a remote build.

To prepare:

 - Get root access to a linux server with lots of cores to use for a build.
   (TODO: provide a general-use one for the hyades project)
 - git clone the main homeworld repository on the remote server (so that you don't have to rsync as much)
 - make sure to check out the same branch (as recently as possible)
 - on the remote server, create a chroot with create-chroot.sh
 - make sure to run pull-upstream.sh on the remote server
 - rsync your local repository's building directory up to the remote server's repository

       rsync --stats --delete -tavz building/ --exclude 'binaries/*' --include '*/binaries/<aptbranch>/*' --exclude 'upload-*' --exclude 'upstream-check/*' --exclude '*/.git/*' <user>@<host>:homeworld/building

 - on the remote server, enter the chroot with enter-chroot.sh
 - run your build with glass
 - rsync the repository's binaries directory back down from the remote server

       rsync --stats -tavz <user>@<host>:homeworld/building/binaries/<aptbranch>/ building/binaries/<aptbranch>
